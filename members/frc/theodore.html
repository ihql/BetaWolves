        <h2>THEODORE</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Hi, my name is <b>Theodore.</b> I'm a Programmer and Marketer for our FRC Team, FTC Mentor and Developer of this website.<br />
          I joined the BetaWovles robotics team in 2022, however wanting to join in 2020 but a medical condition interfearing.<br /><br />
          
          My plan for college is to study Agriculture Science, Mathematics, Computer Science, Software Engineering, Entrepreneurship and Investment. The reason I joined robotics was because of the caring and heartwarming enviornment, this team is the nicest group and smartest<br />
          group of individuals, I have ever worked with. Robotics helps with my Software Engineering and Computer Science fields aswell but that is not the reason to only do it. It is also just a fun and great learning experience for students interested in just having fun.<br /><br />
          
          Something that really touches me in robotics is how it is portrayed. Robotics isn't just a club. It's a family. A group of individuals who care on how you learn and how to grow as a person and robotics student.
          
          <br /><br />
          Something I would say to encourage or inspire someone into robotics is,<br />
          <i>"Robotics is something that can change yourself emotionally and mentally. It's an escape from the people who don't understand who you are, if robotics is interesting to you, do it. Don't mind what others thing of about you and robotics, if you enjoy programming or building things, then<br />
            robotics is for you. This is YOUR time to shine, do you, build and learn with your team."</i>
